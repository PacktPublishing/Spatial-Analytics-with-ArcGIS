The code bundle contains the Map documents with MXD file extension for all the chapters in the book. MXD is a file extension for a map document used by ArcMap. ArcMap is a component of ArcGIS, a GIS (geographic information system) software suite used in the book. GIS enables you to envision the geographic aspects of a body of data.
